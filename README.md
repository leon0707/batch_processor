## install
```shell
pip install batch_processor
```

## quickstart
```python
from threading import Thread
from batch_processor import BatchProcessor

def batch_func(batch):
    return [v + v for v in batch]

def create_bulk_request(n, processor):
    print(n, processor.process(n))

processor = BatchProcessor(batch_func, worker_num=2, batch_size=32)

threads = []
for i in range(200):
    t = Thread(target=create_bulk_request, args=(i, self.processor))
    t.start()
    threads.append(t)

for t in threads:
    t.join()
```

This piece of code mimics 200 incomming requests that can be processed in batches whose size is 32. There are 2 workers. They take batches and double each integers in the batch, then return results in batches.
